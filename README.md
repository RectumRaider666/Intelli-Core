    <h3>What is this :</h3>
    <p> This repository contains the source code for the Intellicap Software and its features.
        Intellicap is the predescessor to Friends Mutual, a *TERRIBLY* designed Ai Centered Trading Bot and User Entry Point, designed by yours truly.
        After release of Friends Mutual, I continued my coding journey and quickly realized that I have never *Developed* a single thing in my life.
        All I was doing was scripting brute-force solutions to complete a task and calling it 'development'. This was also the day I learned what OS-Agnostic, KISS, & DRY Coding was....
        Not my proudest coding moment but hey I did eventually do it right? XD
        Then during some downtime I created a Private Server that hosts personalized directories with the Intellicap repo and began collaborating with others so we can all learn and develop features into actual products.
        SO! After a name change,because dear GOD did I code a terribly pipelined monstrosity that, I honestly look back on with a little bit of respect for the crazy ways I got this to work and decently too.
        So I ended up just quickly ended up settling on the name Intellicap, and purchasing my first domain <a href="https://www.intellicap.org"></a>
        At which point I created this repository to track my development progress and attempt to convert my 'CodDInG SkILLS' into actual Development Skills and Practices that are worth while.
    <h3>So this is what now :</h3>
        Well thats kinda hard to answer cause why stop with just fixing Friends Mutual when I have an entire Google Drive of just outright bad 'programs' I made over the previous 2 years, that potentially could be converted and added as Features to Intellicap!
        So welcome to Intellicap, The Software Developed by purely "No-F*****G-Clue just try it and see whats happens" un-planned collaboration & logic of completely random features!
        Well... I guess Enjoy! Cause this repo is undoubtedly going to be a MESS :)
